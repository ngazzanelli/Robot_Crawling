# Robot-Crawling
Project for Real-Time Systems class (MSc Robotics Engineering)
The project implements the Q-learning algorithm (Reinforcement Learning) for a crawling robot, which has to learn how to move forward.
The crawler is modeled using Lagrange methods for writing dynamic equations. 
Constrained dynamic is resolved using "quasi-velocities" method.
